# **Individual bios**

**2.**

I like simplicity, as long as it is the right solution. I like complicated artistic expression if it is unique. Less is less, more is more and sometimes any combination will produce the best result. I like to meet people from different backgrounds, I like to work with people with unique skills. (Petr Štěpán)

- The phrase “any combination will produce the best result” suggests an  adaptability. 
- Expressing a desire to meet people from diverse backgrounds.

**3.**

I am a graphic designer bred by London, the cafes of Letna and UMPRUM. I love the challenges that come with each new commission or project. I always try to fit the design to the needs of the project, not the project to the needs of the design. ([Vítek Škop](https://vitekvitek.com/About-1))

- The statement is straightforward and to the point.
- Describing yourself as "bred by London, the cafes of Letna, and UMPRUM" adds a personal narrative that connects your identity to specific places, making it more relatable and memorable.

# My own design manifesto
 
  


- Design is not about repetition. Every great design pushes boundaries and dares to be different. Innovation isn’t just about newness; it’s about thinking beyond the obvious, solving problems in unexpected ways.


- Great design communicates. It transcends language and culture, speaking directly to the viewer’s senses. A design may be beautiful, but if it isn’t clear, if it doesn’t make sense in context, then it has failed. 



- Trends come and go, but great design is timeless. We build with longevity in mind—not just in terms of aesthetics but in function, too. The designs we create today should still resonate tomorrow. Good design isn’t about being of the moment; it’s about being lasting, relevant, and adaptable over time. 



- Design is in the details. It’s not just about the big picture; it’s about the nuance, the tiny choices that make something truly remarkable. Each curve, each line, each spacing decision should be purposeful and intentional. Great design is built on precision—the smallest detail can elevate an entire project.



- Good design doesn’t shout for attention—it whispers, gently guiding the viewer without overwhelming them. It knows when to be bold and when to fade into the background. Design should be a subtle presence, enhancing the experience without distracting from it. The best designs are almost invisible in their elegance, unobtrusive in their functionality. It should never feel forced or out of place.


- A design that’s functional but not aesthetically pleasing lacks soul. Aesthetics are essential to creating an emotional connection between the design and its audience. Aesthetics evoke emotion.
