about me

Hi! My name is Alice and I've been surrounded by animals my whole life, which sparked my passion for photography. Through this interest, I discovered graphic design, a field I studied in high school and am now continuing at university. My journey with animals and art has shaped my creative path, blending my love for nature with my design skills.
