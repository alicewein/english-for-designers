**Czech Tennis Reimagined**

From a nation of just 10.5 million people has emerged a tennis powerhouse that produces Grand Slam champions with remarkable consistency. While its reputation for excellence is unquestioned, its visual identity and market positioning feel outdated, struggling to connect with younger players and fans. **The challenge:** to revitalize a national tennis brand without losing the authentic Czech character that has defined its success for generations.

**The Logo: Where Simplicity Speaks**

The centerpiece of the new brand identity is a deceptively simple yet deeply meaningful logo. Set in lowercase letters, the word "czech tennis" embodies the brand's approachable, modern ethos. The distinctive feature—a dot above the "i" reimagined as a tennis ball—creates an instant visual connection to the sport while maintaining a clean, contemporary aesthetic. This thoughtful detail transforms an ordinary typographic element into a powerful symbol, representing both the precision of Czech tennis and its playful spirit. The lowercase treatment reflects the brand's humble confidence—a nod to the nation's understated approach to excellence that has defined Czech tennis for generations.

**From Clay to Canvas**

The revitalization of the Czech tennis brand revolves around a bold design concept: fluid lines reminiscent of brush strokes, infused with the distinctive texture of clay courts. This innovative approach goes beyond modernizing the visual identity—it embodies the sport’s dynamic movement. The brushstroke motif serves as a unifying element, seamlessly integrating across all brand touchpoints, from the logo and typography to merchandise and digital platforms, bringing motion, artistry, and authenticity to the brand.
