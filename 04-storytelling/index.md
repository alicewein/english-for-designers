# **Beyond the Margins: A Personal History in Design**


## **Chapter 1: Seeds of Creativity**

As a ten-year-old, my bedroom floor was perpetually covered in magazine clippings, scissors, and glue sticks. 

*My passion project: creating horse magazines for my friends at school.*

I didn't think of it as "design" back then. I simply saw a gap that needed filling. There wasn't a magazine that covered horses the way my friends and I wanted, so I made one myself. 


Looking back, those early collages were my first attempt at solving a communication problem through visual means. I was unknowingly practicing **layout design** and **visual hierarchy**.

## **Chapter 2: Typography and Rock ‚n‘ Roll**

One formative memory that stands out was discovering a book in our family home called *Love Is a Guitar Solo*.

It wasn't meant for me—my dad had bought it because he loved rock music but didn't speak English well enough to understand the lyrics of Bob Dylan and John Lennon etc. The book translated their poetic words into Czech.

What captivated me wasn't the translations themselves but how they were presented. The typography, the spatial arrangement, the interplay between text and image—it opened my eyes to design as a language of its own. 


### Without realizing it, I was receiving my first masterclass in editorial design and typography.

## **Chapter 3: Punk Rock and Visual Rebellion**

The Czech punk scene became a visual education as much as an auditory one. I was fascinated by bands like *Visací zámek*, whose crude band name scrawled in white paint against black became an iconic visual shorthand.

### **It wasn't polished or perfect—it was raw, immediate, and authentic.**

 
I started admire vinyl records in our home as much for their covers as for the music they contained. The album Start 02 particularly struck me with its clever appropriation of our most popular cigarette packaging. Here was design that commented on culture while participating in it—subversive, witty, and unmistakably punk.

What impressed me most was how these artists created striking visual identities despite censorship. They couldn't always say what they wanted directly through words, so they communicated through visual codes and references. 

### **It taught me that design could speak when words had to remain silent, that visual communication had its own powerful vocabulary of rebellion and expression.**

## **Chapter 4: The Cultural Foundation**

My high school art teacher fundamentally changed my understanding of what makes good design. Unlike other instructors who focused solely on technical skills, he insisted that no one could create meaningful design without a deep understanding of culture at large.

In his class, we discussed films, literature, politics, scientific discoveries—seemingly everything except design techniques. 

*"How can you communicate with a society you don't understand?" he would challenge us. "How can you speak visually to people whose visual language you haven't studied?"*


Under his guidance, I began consuming culture voraciously, not just design but everything that informed it.

## **Chapter 5: Finding My Voice**

As I approached graduation, I started developing my professional portfolio. The influences of my childhood collages, that typography book, punk album covers, and my teacher's cultural emphasis had coalesced into a distinctive approach.


*I realized that the best design doesn't exist in isolation but in conversation with its cultural moment.*

What began as childhood crafting had evolved into a sophisticated understanding of design as cultural practice. I'd found my voice not just as a designer but as a visual communicator with something to say.
